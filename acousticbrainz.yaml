# Turning on fingerprinting can increase the accuracy of the autotagger - especially on files with very poor metadata.
# The Acoustid plugin extends the autotagger to use acoustic fingerprinting to find information for arbitrary audio.
# Install that plugin if youâ€™re willing to spend a little more CPU power to get tags for unidentified albums.
# (But be aware that it does slow down the process.)
